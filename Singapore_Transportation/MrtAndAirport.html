        <p>As part of the infrastructure visualization, a focus has been placed on Singapore's subway system. Initiated
            as part of the government's urban planning strategies and to address traffic management needs, the MRT
            system's first line, the North-South Line, was completed in 1987 (Newman and Kenworthy, 1999). Over the
            years, the system has undergone expansion, contributing significantly to Singapore's urban development and
            mobility (Barter, 2008).The role of Changi Airport, Singapore's primary civilian airport, is also
            emphasized. Since its inception in 1981, Changi has been one of the largest transportation hubs in Southeast
            Asia and has experienced continuous expansion to accommodate increasing air traffic and meet the diverse
            needs of international travelers (Phang and Foo, 2002).

        <p> It appears that the largest volume of exports and imports is transacted with other Asian countries, further
            illustrating the close trade ties Singapore shares with the region. The significant amount of imports from
            Mainland China and Europe, along with considerable exports to Oceania and Mainland China, reveal Singapore's
            diversified and global trade connections.</p>

        <div id="trade2"></div>
        <p>Singapore's trade strategy is notably anchored in its geographical position and economic requirements. As a
            nation limited by its size, it necessitates substantial imports of goods and resources from abroad. At the
            same time, Singapore's export focus on high-tech products and services echoes its economic growth strategy,
            which leverages trade interactions with different regions globally (Heng, 1997; Huff, 1994; Ho, 2003).</p>
